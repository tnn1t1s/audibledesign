# Foreword

Welcome to this updated exploration of sound composition, inspired by Trevor Wishart's seminal work, "Audible Design." While we maintain Wishart's fundamental approach to understanding and manipulating sound, this book takes a fresh direction by grounding its examples in the rich history of electronic and dance music.

Where Wishart used custom-created sounds and compositions, we dive into the familiar territory of influential electronic tracks. This approach serves a dual purpose: it provides instantly recognizable material for our audio experiments, and it offers insight into the techniques that have shaped modern music production.

Throughout these pages, you'll encounter samples and references to groundbreaking tracks such as:

1. "Revolution 909" by Daft Punk, known for its innovative use of samples from the Hollywood Edge Sound Effects Library.
2. "Little Fluffy Clouds" by The Orb, a landmark in ambient house music, famous for its spoken word samples and ethereal soundscapes.
3. The "Amen Break," a drum solo from The Winstons' "Amen, Brother" that became the foundation of numerous electronic music genres.
4. "Long Dark Tunnel" by Future Sound of London, exemplifying the layered, atmospheric approach of 90s electronica.

These examples, among others, will serve as our sonic playground. We'll dissect them, transform them, and use them to illustrate the principles of sound composition in the digital age.

By bridging Wishart's theoretical approach with practical examples from electronic music history, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of sound manipulation techniques. Whether you're a budding producer, a seasoned composer, or simply curious about the mechanics behind the music you love, this book offers both technical insight and creative inspiration.

As we embark on this journey through the world of audible design, remember that the techniques we explore are not just academic exercisesâ€”they are the very tools that have shaped the soundtrack of the past few decades. Let's dive in and discover the boundless possibilities of sound.
