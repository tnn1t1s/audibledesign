# Forward: From Theory to Practice - The Evolution of Grains in Electronic Music

Wishart's exploration of grains in sound composition laid the theoretical groundwork for techniques that would later revolutionize electronic music production. While his work predates the practical applications we'll discuss, it's remarkable how prescient his ideas were, anticipating the creative use of micro-sound elements that would emerge in the following decades.

## Basic Channel and the Birth of Minimal Deep Techno

In the early 2000s, Basic Channel, the collaborative project of Moritz von Oswald and Mark Ernestus, began experimenting with heavily processed sound grains in combination with deep reverb and delay effects. Their approach, influenced by dub techniques learned from Lee "Scratch" Perry, gave birth to a new genre: minimal deep techno.

Basic Channel's innovation lay in their ability to take Wishart's concept of grains and apply it to rhythm and texture in dance music. By processing tiny fragments of sound and immersing them in cavernous spaces created by reverb and delay, they created a sound that was at once minimalist and deeply engaging. Tracks like "Phylyps Trak" (1993) exemplify this approach, where grainy, heavily processed percussion elements seem to dissolve into a sea of reverb, creating a hypnotic, almost aquatic soundscape.

This technique didn't just create a new sound; it redefined the relationship between foreground and background elements in electronic music. The grains, often so processed as to be unrecognizable from their source, became the focal point of the music, blurring the line between rhythm and texture.

## Justice and the Art of Sonic Infection

Fast forward to 2006, and we see another evolution in the use of grains with the French electronic duo Justice. Their approach, while different from Basic Channel's, still resonates with Wishart's ideas about the power of micro-sound elements.

Justice took the concept of grains to an extreme, using sound fragments even smaller than those typically needed to clear a sample. These micro-samples, often just a few milliseconds long, were used to "sonically infect" their tracks. This technique allowed them to incorporate elements from a wide range of sources without triggering copyright issues, while also creating a unique, glitchy aesthetic.

In tracks like "D.A.N.C.E." from their album "†" (Cross), Justice created a sound that was simultaneously familiar and alien. The micro-samples, pulled from disco and funk records, were reassembled into new rhythmic and melodic patterns, creating a sound that nodded to the past while pushing firmly into the future.

## Connecting the Dots

Wishart's work on grains provides the theoretical underpinning for both these approaches. His exploration of the qualitative properties of grains – their spectral content, their duration, their envelope – gives us the language to understand what Basic Channel and Justice were doing intuitively.

Basic Channel's use of processed grains to create texture and space aligns with Wishart's ideas about the perceptual fusion of micro-sounds. Justice's technique of "sonic infection" through micro-sampling resonates with Wishart's discussions on the threshold between perceivable grains and continuous sounds.

As we delve into Wishart's exploration of grains in this chapter, it's worth keeping these later developments in mind. They serve as practical demonstrations of the power and versatility of granular techniques in sound composition. More importantly, they show how theoretical concepts can evolve into tools for creative expression, reshaping the landscape of electronic music in the process.

## From Theory to Practice: Our Examples

As we explore Wishart's concepts throughout this book, you'll notice that our examples draw directly from influential electronic dance music tracks. This approach serves two purposes: it grounds our technical explorations in familiar territory for many readers, and it demonstrates how theoretical sound concepts have been applied in genre-defining music.

For instance, in our exploration of granular synthesis and sequencing techniques, we use Josh Wink's seminal acid house track "Higher State of Consciousness" (1995) as a case study. This track, known for its intense, evolving acid line and scattered vocal samples, provides an excellent demonstration of how granular techniques can be used to create dynamic, engaging electronic music.

In our SuperCollider examples, you'll see how we recreate and manipulate elements reminiscent of Wink's track:

- We use Pbind for sequencing to mimic the relentless, evolving 303-style acid line that forms the backbone of "Higher State of Consciousness."
- Our scatter techniques demonstrate how Wink might have achieved the disjointed, granular vocal effects that punctuate the track.
- Through these examples, we not only learn the technical aspects of granular synthesis and sequencing but also gain insight into how these techniques contributed to the development of the acid house genre.

Similar approaches are taken with other examples throughout the book. You'll see nods to artists like Aphex Twin, Autechre, and Squarepusher, each chosen not just for their musical influence, but for how their work exemplifies particular granular and spectral techniques.

By connecting Wishart's theoretical groundwork to both the genre-defining tracks of the '90s and 2000s and our own SuperCollider implementations, we create a bridge between theory, historical practice, and modern production techniques. This approach allows you to not only understand the concepts but also to see (and hear) how they've shaped the evolution of electronic music.

As you work through the examples, consider how you might apply these techniques to create your own innovative sounds and structures. Remember, the artists we're referencing weren't just using technology – they were pushing its boundaries to create new sonic possibilities. In the same spirit, let these examples inspire you to explore beyond the given parameters and discover your own unique applications of granular techniques.
