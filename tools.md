## Supercollider

## pyDub
While it is possible to do audio manipulation in supercollider, there are tools in the python ecosystem that are specialized for slicing and stretching audio. In some example, i will use pydub to prepare audio samples that can then be sequenced in supercollider.

## librosa
for many exercises, transforming from audio from time to frequency domain is a critical first step. librosa seems to be the leading way to do this in python environments. 
librosa is a Python library for music and audio analysis, we can perform a more sophisticated examination of an audio file to estimate its tonal center or key. librosa includes functions specifically designed for music theory analysis, such as key and chord detection, which can give us a more accurate understanding of the tonal center.
