# Exercise 2.21: Pitch-Shifting Noisy Sounds

## Concept
This exercise demonstrates how pitch-changing techniques can be applied to sounds without a definite pitch, as described in Trevor Wishart's "Audible Design". We use a simulated 808-style snare drum (a primarily noisy sound) and apply pitch-shifting to alter its perceived "pitch-band" or tessitura.

## Key Points
1. Pitch-changing techniques can meaningfully affect unpitched or noisy sounds.
2. These techniques change the "center-of-energy" or overall spectral character of the sound.
3. The effect is perceived as a shift in the sound's tessitura rather than a change in a specific pitch.

## Implementation in SuperCollider
The provided SuperCollider code creates a SynthDef that:
- Generates a noise-based snare drum sound.
- Applies pitch-shifting to this sound using the PitchShift UGen.
- Allows for real-time control of the pitch-shift amount.

## Code Highlights
```supercollider
SynthDef(\pitchedSnare808, {
    arg out=0, sustain=0.1, amp=0.5, pitchShift=1;
    var snd, env, pitched;
    
    env = EnvGen.ar(Env.perc(0.005, sustain, 1, -4), doneAction: 2);
    snd = PinkNoise.ar(2) * Line.ar(1, 0, 0.2) * env;
    
    pitched = PitchShift.ar(snd, 0.2, pitchShift, 0.01, 0.01);
    
    Out.ar(out, Pan2.ar(pitched * amp, 0));
}).add;
```

## PitchShift Parameters
- Window Size: 0.2 seconds (balance between responsiveness and smoothness)
- Pitch Shift Ratio: Controlled by `pitchShift` argument
- Pitch Dispersion: 0.01 (subtle chorus-like effect)
- Time Dispersion: 0.01 (subtle smoothing of artifacts)

## Running the Code
1. Copy the entire code block into SuperCollider.
2. Evaluate the block (Cmd+Enter or Ctrl+Enter).
3. The script will automatically play three versions of the snare:
   - Original pitch
   - Pitched up (1.5 times original)
   - Pitched down (0.75 times original)

## What to Listen For
- Changes in the overall "brightness" or "depth" of the snare sound
- Shift in the perceived center of the noise spectrum
- Retention of the snare's noisy character despite pitch changes

## Significance
This exercise illuminates how our perception of "pitch" extends beyond traditionally pitched sounds. It demonstrates that the spectral content of any sound, even noise, contributes to our sense of its pitch or register.

## Relation to Wishart's "Audible Design"
Wishart uses this example to expand our understanding of pitch manipulation. By applying pitch-changing techniques to non-pitched sounds, he encourages composers to think beyond conventional notions of pitch and explore the full spectrum of sound manipulation.

## Further Exploration
- Experiment with different pitch-shift ratios
- Try applying this technique to other non-pitched sounds (e.g., cymbals, white noise)
- Explore how different window sizes and dispersion values affect the result

This exercise provides insights into the malleability of sound and opens up creative possibilities for sound design and composition, especially when working with percussion and noise-based sounds.
