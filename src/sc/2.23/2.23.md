# Exercise 2.23: Jet Noise with Formant Shifting

## Concept
This exercise demonstrates how formant shifting can create the illusion of pitch change in a noise-based sound, as described in Trevor Wishart's "Audible Design". We simulate a jet taking off and landing using white noise and dynamic formant shifting.

## Implementation
The SuperCollider code creates a `jetNoise` SynthDef that:
- Uses white noise as the sound source
- Applies an envelope to control formant shifting over time
- Uses bandpass filters to create resonances simulating jet engine harmonics
- Combines takeoff and landing into a single, continuous sound

## Key Points
1. Formant shifting can create perceived pitch changes in non-pitched sounds
2. Envelopes can be used to control formant shifts dynamically
3. The illusion of motion (takeoff/landing) is created without actual pitch changes

## Code Highlights
```supercollider
env = Env([1, 4, 1], [dur * 0.5, dur * 0.5], [2, -2]);
formantShift = EnvGen.kr(env);
filter = BPF.ar(source, [800, 2000, 3500] * formantShift, [0.1, 0.05, 0.05]).sum;
```

## Usage
1. Copy the entire code block into SuperCollider
2. Evaluate the code (Cmd+Enter or Ctrl+Enter)
3. Listen to the jet takeoff and landing sound

## What to Listen For
- The perceived rise and fall in pitch despite using only noise
- How the changing formants create the illusion of motion

## Relation to Wishart's "Audible Design"
This example illustrates Wishart's exploration of pitch perception beyond traditional pitched sounds, demonstrating how spectral manipulation can create compelling sonic illusions.
