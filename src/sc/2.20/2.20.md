# Exercise 2.20: Spectral Stretching and Pitch Drift

## Concept
This exercise demonstrates the phenomenon of pitch drift associated with spectral stretching, as described in Trevor Wishart's "Audible Design". When the partials of a harmonic spectrum are gradually moved so that they are no longer whole number multiples of the fundamental frequency, our perception of pitch can change in interesting ways.

## Key Points
1. Starting with a harmonic spectrum, we gradually stretch the partials upwards.
2. As the spectrum becomes inharmonic, the sound begins to present multiple perceived pitches, similar to bell sounds.
3. Even when the fundamental frequency remains unchanged, the perceived pitch may drift upwards as the upper partials are stretched.

## Implementation in SuperCollider
The provided SuperCollider code creates a SynthDef that:
- Generates 10 partials starting from a 100 Hz fundamental.
- Uses a Line UGen to gradually increase the stretch factor over 10 seconds.
- Applies the stretch factor incrementally to each partial, with higher partials stretched more.
- Mixes the partials together to create the final output.

## Code Highlights
- `stretchLFO = Line.kr(1, 2, 10);`: Controls the amount of stretch over time.
- Frequency calculation: `freq = fundamental * (i + 1) * (1 + (i * (stretchLFO - 1) / numPartials));`
  This formula applies increasing stretch to higher partials.
- Simple amplitude rolloff: `amp = 1 / (i + 1);`

## Running the Code
1. Copy the entire SynthDef block into SuperCollider.
2. Evaluate the block (Cmd+Enter or Ctrl+Enter).
3. Run `x = Synth(\spectralStretch);` to start the sound.
4. Use `x.free;` to stop the sound.

## What to Listen For
- Initial clear, harmonic pitch
- Gradual transition to a more complex, bell-like timbre
- Possible perception of upward pitch drift, despite unchanged fundamental

## Significance
This exercise illuminates the complex relationship between spectral content and pitch perception. It challenges the simple notion that pitch is determined solely by the fundamental frequency, demonstrating how the brain interprets the overall spectral shape in forming pitch percepts.

## Relation to Wishart's "Audible Design"
Wishart uses this example to explore the malleability of sound and perception. It exemplifies his approach of using technology to reveal and manipulate subtle aspects of psychoacoustics, encouraging composers to think beyond traditional notions of pitch and timbre.

## Further Exploration
- Experiment with different stretch amounts and rates.
- Try preserving certain partials while stretching others.
- Explore how different initial harmonic structures affect the perceived pitch drift.

This exercise provides a fascinating insight into the nature of pitch perception and opens up creative possibilities for sound design and composition.
