# Exercise 2.19: Filtered Shepard Tone

## Concept
This exercise builds upon the Shepard tone illusion introduced in Exercise 2.18. We add filtering to emphasize specific harmonics within the spectrum, similar to the effect heard in Tibetan chanting or Tuvan throat singing. This demonstrates how filtering can draw attention to particular partials, allowing them to be perceived as distinct pitches.

## Implementation
We use SuperCollider to create a Shepard tone and apply a Moog-style low-pass filter. Key components include:

1. A Shepard tone generator creating the illusion of an endlessly rising or falling pitch.
2. A Moog-style low-pass filter (MoogFF) set to a cutoff frequency of 808 Hz.
3. An LFO (Low Frequency Oscillator) to modulate the Shepard tone's pitch and amplitude.

## Code Highlights
- `SynthDef(\shepardToneFiltered, {...})`: Defines our instrument.
- `MoogFF.ar(tone, 808, 3)`: Applies the Moog-style filter with a cutoff at 808 Hz.
- The ironic use of 808 Hz as a cutoff frequency, nodding to the Roland TR-808 drum machine.

## Musical Context
- Tibetan chanting and Tuvan throat singing involve techniques that emphasize specific harmonics within the voice.
- This exercise simulates this effect electronically, allowing exploration of harmonic emphasis in a controlled environment.

## Running the Code
1. Copy the entire SynthDef block into SuperCollider.
2. Evaluate the block (Cmd+Enter or Ctrl+Enter).
3. Run `x = Synth(\shepardToneFiltered);` to start the sound.
4. Use `x.free;` to stop the sound.

## Exploration Ideas
1. Experiment with different cutoff frequencies to emphasize various harmonics.
2. Adjust the resonance parameter in the MoogFF filter to change the emphasis.
3. Try different base frequencies or number of octaves in the Shepard tone.

## Relation to Wishart's "Audible Design"
This exercise demonstrates Wishart's approach to sound manipulation, exploring how filtering can transform our perception of a complex tone. It bridges traditional vocal techniques with electronic sound synthesis, encouraging creative exploration of timbre and psychoacoustic phenomena.
