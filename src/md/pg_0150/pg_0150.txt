Similarly, some artists seek out exact rational proportions, golden sections or, more recently, fractality,
in everything. Perhaps it may seem to reveal the hand of the ultimate designer in all things. or, as with
Plato, reality may be conceived as a hidden world of fixed Ideals to which everyday reality corresponds
with varying degrees of success. In such a world, the score (the text), or the compositional idea or
method, may be viewed as a musical Ideal and its realisation in performance an adequate or poor
reflection of this Ideal object. Reality is set in stone, or print, in the exact proportions of architecture, the
unchanging fixity of the text, the codification of the artist's method.
For artists like myself, reality is flow, growth, change and ultimate uncertainty. Texts, from the
religious to the scientific, are our mortal attempts to hold this flow in our grasps so we can understand it
and perhaps control it a little. Compositional methods are, like engineering methods, subject to test, and
ultimately to possible failure.
For a certain time a procedure, an approach, a theory, works, until we discover new facts, new
symmetries, new symmetry breaking, and those texts have to be revised or rewritten, the proportions
of our architecture reconsidered, the appropriateness of our methods reassessed in the light of
experience.
For me, sound-composition, in seeking the measure of the evanescent flow of sonic events, attempts to
grapple with the very essence of human experience.
