INDIAN RAG SYSTEM
The system of scales and associated figures and ornaments at the base of Classical Indian music theory
and practice.
INHARMONIC
A spectrum which is not harmonic, but which is not noise, is said to be inharmonic. Inharmonic spectra
may be bell-like (suggesting several pitches) or drum-like (being focused in some sense but lacking
definitive pitch).
INTERPOLATION
The process of moving gradually between two defined states. See SPECTRAL INTERPOLATION.
INVERSE FOURIER TRANSFORM
A mathematical procedure which allows us to convert an arbitrary spectrum (frequency-domain
representation of a sound) into the corresponding waveform (time-domain representation of the
sound). See also, FOURIER TRANSFORM.
INVERSE KARPLUS STRONG
See SOUND PLUCKING.
