A more difficult question, as with any musical process is, does it matter to the listener that they hear this reordering process? Or, what does this reordering "mean" in the context of an entire composition? Is it another way of looking down a kaleidoscope of possibilities, or a special moment in a time-sequence of events taking on a particular significance in a musical-unfolding because of its particular nature and placement with respect to related events? These are, or course, aesthetic questions going beyond the mere use, or otherwise, of a compositional procedure.
