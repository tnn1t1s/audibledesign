SCORE
The notation of a piece of music from which a performance of the work is recreated.
SEMITONE
The smallest interval between consecutive pitches on a modern European keyboard or fretted
instrument. Musical scales are defined as some pattern of tones (equal to two semitones) and
semitones, HArmonic minor scales also containing a three semitone step.
SEQUENCE GENERATION
1
SEQUENCES
Groups of consecutive sounds having distinctly different spectral properties. e.g. speech, or melodic
phrases on keyed instruments (the spectra of whose elements differ by perceptually significant pitch
steps).
SERIAL COMPOSITION
Style of twentieth century European musical composition in which the 12 pitches of the chromatic scale
are arranged in a specific order, and this sequence (and certain well-specified transformations of it) are
used as the basis for the organisation of pitches in a piece. The general idea of serialism was also
extended to sequences of durations, of loudnesses etc. The even more general notion of permuting a
given set of elements has been more widely used (e.g. systems music).
SERIALISM

SHAWM
A mediaeval wind instrument with a strong reedy sound.
SHEPARD TONES
72
Sounds (or sequences of sounds) constructed so that they rise in tessitura while their pitch falls (or
vice versa).
SINE WAVE
2,5
The elementary oscillations in terms of which all other regular oscillations, vibrations or waveforms can
be described. The oscillation of a simple (idealised) pendulum is described by a sine wave.
SINUSOIDAL
Having the shape of a sine-wave.
