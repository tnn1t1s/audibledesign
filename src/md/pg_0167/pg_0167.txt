OCTAVE
A sound whose pitch is an octave higher than a second sound, usually has twice the frequency of that
second sound. Two pitches separated by an octave, in european music, are regarded in some sense as
the 'same' pitch, or as belonging to the same 'pitch-class'.

PARAMETER
Any property of a sound or a sequence of sounds which can be musically organised, Parameter often
also implies the measurability of that property.
PARTIAL
3
The sinusoidal elements which define the spectrum of a sound.

PERMUTATION
Specific rearrangement of the elements, or the properties of the elements (e.g. loudness), of a sequence
of musical events.
PHASE

PHASE INVERSION
(9)
The sound waveform may be replaced by the same form but 'upside-down' (i.e. the new wave rises
where the other falls and vice versa). The same-effect is achieved with a sinusoidal waveform by
restarting the wave from the first point at which it recrosses the zero-line (known as a phase-shift by
180 degrees, or by PI radians). Superimposing the original sound on its phase-inverted version causes
the sounds to cancel one another.
