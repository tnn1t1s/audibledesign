BAR
A grouping of musical duration-units. The bar-length is measured in some basic musical unit (e.g.
crotchets, quavers) for which a speed (tempo) is given (e.g. 120 crotchets per minutes). In most
musics, bar length is regular for long stretches of time, and bar length is one determinant of perceived
rhythm.
BRASSAGE
44-45
A procedure which chops a sound into a number of segments and then resplices these together tail to
head. In the simplest case sounds are selected in order, from the source, and respliced back together in
order. However there are many possible variations on the procedure. Brassage may be used for
changing the duration of a sound, for evolving montage based on a sound-source, and for many other
musical applications. See also GRANULAR RECONSTRUCTION
BREAKPOINT TABLE
A table which associates the value of some time-varying quantity (e.g. pitch, loudness, spectral stretch
etc.) and the time at which that value is reached. e.g.
(time) (value)
0.0
2.7
1.3
2.2
1.7
2.1
This table allows us to describe the time-varying - trajectory of the quantity, and a musical program may
read the data in the table, interpolating between the given values where necessary, to determine what
to do at a particular time in the source-sound.
