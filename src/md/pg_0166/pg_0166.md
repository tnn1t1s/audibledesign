MORPHOLOGY
The way in which the properties of a sound vary with time.
MOTIF
Small element of musical structure, usually consisting of a sequence of a few pitches (in notated music),
and out of which larger structural units (e.g. phrases) are built.
MULTI-DIMENSIONAL SPACE
A line defines a one-dimensional space, a sheet of paper or the surface (only) of a sphere a
two-dimensional space, and the world we live in is a three-dimensional space. We may generalise the
notion of a space to any group of independent parameters. e.g. pitch and duration may be thought of as
defining a two-dimensional space, and this is the space that we draw in when we notate a traditional
musical score. Spaces may be of any number of dimensions (i.e. not necessarily ones that we can
visualise in our own spatial experience) from the four dimensions of Einstein's space-time, to the
infinite number of dimensions in Hilbert space.
MULTI-SOURCE BRASSAGE
45
NOISE
Sound having no perceptible pitch(es) and in which energy is distributed densely and randomly over the
spectrum and/or in a way which varies randomly with time. Typical examples might be the consonants
's' or 'sh'. Other sounds (especially those recorded directly from the natural environment) may contain
elements of unwanted noise which we may wish to eliminate by noise reduction.
NOISE REDUCTION
Process of eliminating or reducing unwanted noise in a sound source.
