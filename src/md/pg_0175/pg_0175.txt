TESSITURA
Also known as register. In its simplest sense, the range of pitch in question. The tessitura of soprano
voices is higher than that of Tenor voices. However, unpitched (e.g. noise) sounds may rise in tessitura
while having no perceivable pitch, while SHEPARD TONES may rise in tessitura while falling in
pitch(!). Hence tessitura also has something to do with where the main focus of energy lies in the
spectrum (where the loudest groups of partials are to be found).
TEXTURE
Organisation of sound elements in terms of (temporal) density and field properties.
TEXTURE CONTROL
68-69
TEXTURE GENERATION
68-69
TEXTURE OF GROUPS
68
Texture in which small sets of sound elements are considered as the organisable units of the texture,
rather than individual sounds themselves. The sounds forming any particular group are, however,
chosen arbitrarily from the available sound sources.
TEXTURE OF MOTIFS
69
Texture in which specific small sets of sound elements, known as motifs, are considered as the
organisable units of the texture, rather than individual sounds themselves. The sounds forming any
particular motif are in some kind of predefined arrangement (e.g. some combination of sequence, time-
placement, pitch-relationship, formant sequence, etc).
TEXTURE OF ORNAMENTS
69
Texture in which specific small sets of sound elements, known as ornaments, are attached to the
fundamental sound elements of the texture, and each of these may be organised as units of the texture.
TEXTURE STREAM
Dense and relatively disordered sequence of sound events in which specific ordering properties
between individual elements cannot be perceived. Properties may be ordered in terms of Field and
Density.
THRESHOLD
A value either not to be exceeded (or fallen below), or to be noted (in order to cause something else to
happen) if it is thus exceeded.
