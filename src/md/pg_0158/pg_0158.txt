ENVELOPE
The loudness trajectory of a sound (the way the loudness varies through time) is often referred to as
the envelope of the sound. Computer instruments which manipulate this loudness trajectory are usually
called 'Envelope something'. Envelope is also used in the literature to refer to the time-changing
variation of any property (we use the term trajectory) and even to the instantaneous shape of the
spectrum (we use the term contour).
