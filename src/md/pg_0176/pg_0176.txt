TIMBRE
A catch-all term for all those aspects of a sound not included in pitch and duration. Of no value to the
sound composer!
TIME STRETCHING
See spectral time-stretching, granular time-stretching, waveset time-stretching, harmoniser,
brassage.
TIME-DOMAIN REPRESENTATION
The waveform of a sound represented as the variation of air- - pressure with time.
TIME-VARIABLE TIME-STRETCHING
See time-warping.
TIME-WARPING
30
Changing the duration of a sound in a way which itself varies with time.
TONAL MUSIC
Music organised around keys and the progression between different keys. In contrast, atonal music
avoids indicating the dominance of any particular key or pitch.
TONE
The interval between the first two pitches of a major (or minor) scale in European music. European
scales consist of patterns of tones and semitones (half a tone) and, in some cases 3-semitone steps.
TRAJECTORY
The variation of some property with time. e.g. loudness trajectory, pitch trajectory, formant trajectory.
Loudness trajectory is often also known as 'envelope' and instruments which manipulate the loudness
trajectory are here called 'Envelope something'.
TREMOLO
66
Cyclical undulations of loudness between C. 4 and 20 cycles per second.
TRANSPOSITION
Changing the pitch of a sound, or sound sequence.
TRIGGERING
62
Using the value of some time-varying property (usually the loudness) of a sound to cause something
else to happen.
