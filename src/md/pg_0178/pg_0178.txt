WHITE-OUT
A musical process in which a texture becomes so dense that all spectral detail is lost, producing a noise
band.
WINDOW
In sound analysis (conversion from waveform to spectrum, to spectral envelope or to time-varying
filter-coefficients : see LPC) a window is a very brief slice of time (a few milliseconds) in which we
make a spectral analysis, before passing to the next window to make our next analysis. We hence
discover how the spectrum changes in time. Not to be confused with analysis CHANNEL.
WINDOWED FFT
A Fast Fourier Transform that is performed over a brief slice of time (a window), then performed over
and over again at successive windows throughout the entire duration of the sound. The Phase Vocoder
is a windowed FFT.
