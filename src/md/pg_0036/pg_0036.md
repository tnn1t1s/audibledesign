In sound composition a relationship between two sounds is established only through aurally perceptible similarity or relatedness, regardless of the methodological rigour of the process which transforms one sound into another.

Another important aspect of Savouret's talk was to distinguish between source-focused transformation (where the nature of the resulting sound is strongly related to the input sound, (e.g. time-stretching of a signal with a stable spectrum, retaining the onset unstretched) and process-focused transformations (where the nature of the resulting sound is more strongly determined by the transformation process itself, e.g. using very short time digital delay of a signal, superimposed on the non-delayed signal to produce delay-time related pitched ringing). There is, of course, an interesting area of ambiguity between the two extremes.

In general, process-focused transformations need to be used sparingly. Often when a new compositional technique emerges, e.g. pitch parallelism via the harmonizer, there is an initial rush of excitement to explore the new sound possibilities. But such process-focused transformations can rapidly become cliches.

Transformations focused in the source, however, retain the same infinite potential that the infinity of natural sound sources offer us. Sound-processing procedures which are sensitive to the evolving properties (pitch, loudness, spectral form and contour etc.) of the source-sound are those most likely to bring rich musical rewards.
