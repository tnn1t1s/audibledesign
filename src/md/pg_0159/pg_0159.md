***** F *****
F5
The pitch 'F' in the European scale, in the 5th octave.
FAST FOURIER TRANSFORM
A very efficient computer algorithm for performing the Fourier Transform.
FF
Fortissimo = very loud.
FIBONACCI SERIES
Series of numbers in which each term is given by the sum of the previous two terms. The sequence
begins with 1,1 and is hence..
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 etc
The ratio between successive terms
1/1, 1/2, 2/3, 3/5, 5/8, 8/13, 24/21, 21/34, 34/55 etc.
approaches closer and closer to the Golden Section as one goes up the series.
FIELD
A set of values defined for some property. e.g. the pitches of the scale of G minor define a Field. Any
pitch of the tempered scale lies either in that field or outside it. Any pitch within the pitch continuum lies
close (in some perceptually defined sense) to that Field or not.
FILTER
7-8
An instrument which changes the loudness of the spectral components of a sound (even reducing some
to zero).
FILTER BANK

FLUTTER-TONGUING
A way of articulating a granular sound on breath controlled instruments (woodwind or brass) by
making a rolled 'r' in the mouth while producing a pitch on the instrument.
