PREFACE
The main body of this book was written at the Institute of Sonology at the Royal Conservatory in the Hague, where I was invited as composer in residence by Clarence Barlow, in 1993. Some clarifications and supplementary material was added after discussions with Miller Puckette, Zak Settel, Stephan Bilbao and Philippe Depalle at IRCAM. However, the blame for any inaccuracies or inconsistencies in the exposition rests entirely with me. The text of the book was originally written entirely in longhand and I am indebted to Wendy McGreavy for transferring these personal pretechnological hieroglyphs to computer files. Help with the final text layout was provided by Tony Myatt of the University of York.

My career in music-making with computers would not have been possible without the existence of a community of like-minded individuals committed to making powerful and open music-computing tools available to composers on affordable domestic technology. 1 am therefore especially indebted to the Composers Desktop Project and would hence like to thank my fellow contributors to this long running project; in particular Tom Endrich, the real driving force at the heart of the CDP, to whom we owe the survival, expansion and development of this cooperative venture, against all odds, and whose persistent probing and questioning has led to clear instrument descriptions & musician-friendly documentation; Richard Orton and Andrew Bentley, the other composer founder members of, and core instrument contributors to the project; David Malham who devised the hardware bases of the CDP and much else, and continues to give support; Martin Atkins, whose computer science knowledge and continuing commitment made, and continues to make, the whole project possible (and from whom I have very slowly learnt to program less anarchically, if not yet elegantly!); Rajmil Fischman of the University of Keele, who has been principally responsible for developing the various graphic interfaces to the system; and to Michael Clarke, Nick Laviers, Rob Waring, Richard Dobson and to the many students at the Universities of York, Keele, and Birmingham and to individual users elsewhere, who have supported, used and helped sustain and develop this resource.

All the sound examples accompanying this book were either made specifically for this publication, or come from my own compositions Red Bird, The VOX Cycle or Tongues of Fire, except for one item, and I would like to thank Paul de Marinis and Lovely Music for permitting me to use the example in Chapter 2 from the piece Odd Evening on the CD Music as a Second Language (Lovely Music LCD 3011). Thanks are also due to Francis Newton, for assistance with data transfer to DAT.
