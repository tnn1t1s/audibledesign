LOUDNESS
Technically speaking, loudness is a property which is related to perception, and is measured in a way
which takes into account the varying sensitivity of the ear over different frequency ranges. In this sense
it differs from the Amplitude of the signal, which is a scientific measure of the strength of a sound. In
this book, the term loudness is used in the text, wherever this will not cause any confusion. Diagrams
usually refer to Amplitude.
