DENSITY
Describes the way in which a range is filled. Applies particularly to time ranges. A high-density texture
has a great many events in a short time. Temporal density is a primary property of
TEXTURE-STREAMS. The concept of density can also be applied to pitch-ranges.
DESTRUCTIVE DISTORTION
An irreversible transformation of the waveform of a sound, changing its spectral quality (the brightness,
noisiness etc), rather than the pitch or duration. Distortion also implies the degradation of the sound
(and irreversibility means that the original sound cannot be restored from the distorted version).
Destructive distortion which preserves zero-crossing points can be musically useful. See
WAVESETS.
DIPHONE SYNTHESIS
The reconstruction of speech (usually) by synthesising the transitions between significant phonemes
(roughly speaking, vowels & consonants) rather than the phonemes themselves.
DRONE
A pitched or multipitched sustained sound which persists for a long time.
DUCKING
62
Means of ensuring the prominence of a lead 'voice' in a mix.
DURATION
The length of time a sound persists. Not to be confused with event-onset-separation-dration which is
the time between the start of successive sound events.
DYNAMIC INTERPOLATION
The process whereby a sound gradually changes into a different (kind of) sound during the course of a
single sonic event.
