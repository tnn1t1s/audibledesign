APPENDIX 1

(Page numbers refer to the diagrammatic Appendix 2).

ACCELERANDO

An increase in the speed at which musical events succeed one another.

ACCUMULATION

Sound which 'gathers momentum' (increases in loudness and spectral content) as it proceeds.

ALL-PASS FILTER ... 9

AMPLITUDE

A scientific measure of the strength of a sound-signal. This normally reveals itself in perception as the loudness of the sound, but amplitude and loudness and not equivalent. In particular, the sensitivity of the human ear varies from one frequency range to another, hence Amplitude and perceived loudness are not identical. However, in this book, the term Loudness is used, instead of Amplitude, in the text, wherever this does not cause any confusion. Diagrams however usually refer to Amplitude.

ANALYSIS

In this book analysis almost always refers to Fourier Analysis, the process of converting the waveform (time-domain representation) of a sound into its spectrum (frequency-domain representation).  Analysis of musical scores is the process of determining the essential structural features of a composition from its notated representation in a score. This notion might be generalised to include any process attempting to uncover the underlying structure of a piece of music.

ARTICULATION

The (conscious) changing/moving of a property of a sound, usually in a way bound by conventions (of language, musical practice etc) but often not appearing as such in any associated notation system.

ATTACK

The onset portion of a sound where it achieves its initial maximum loudness.

BAR
A grouping of musical duration-units. The bar-length is measured in some basic musical unit (e.g.
crotchets, quavers) for which a speed (tempo) is given (e.g. 120 crotchets per minutes). In most
musics, bar length is regular for long stretches of time, and bar length is one determinant of perceived
rhythm.
BRASSAGE
44-45
A procedure which chops a sound into a number of segments and then resplices these together tail to
head. In the simplest case sounds are selected in order, from the source, and respliced back together in
order. However there are many possible variations on the procedure. Brassage may be used for
changing the duration of a sound, for evolving montage based on a sound-source, and for many other
musical applications. See also GRANULAR RECONSTRUCTION
BREAKPOINT TABLE
A table which associates the value of some time-varying quantity (e.g. pitch, loudness, spectral stretch
etc.) and the time at which that value is reached. e.g.
(time) (value)
0.0
2.7
1.3
2.2
1.7
2.1
This table allows us to describe the time-varying - trajectory of the quantity, and a musical program may
read the data in the table, interpolating between the given values where necessary, to determine what
to do at a particular time in the source-sound.
113
CADENCE
A recognised device in a musical language which signals the end of a musical phrase, section or piece.
CAUSALITY
The way in which the sound was apparently initiated. NOT the actual cause of the sound. Was the
source apparently struck, rubbed, shaken, spun etc. ??
CHANGE RINGING
A form of bell-ringing in which the order in which the bells are sounded is permuted in specific ways.
CHANNEL
Channel is most often used in this book to refer to an analysis channel. We derive the spectrum
(frequency domain representation) of a sound from its waveform (time-domain representation) by a
process of analysis. In doing the analysis we must decide how accurate we would like to be. We may
search for a partial in each block of 100 cycles per second (i.e. between 50 and 150, 150 and 250, 250
and 350 etc) or, more discriminatingly, in each block of 10 cycles per second (i.e. between 5 and 15, 15
and 25, 25 and 30 etc.). These search blocks are the channels of the analysis. Channels should not be
confused with WINDOWS.
Channel is also used to refer to the right hand and left hand parts of a stereo sound (which can be
viewed as two separate streams of digital information).
CHORD
A set of pitches initiated and sounding at the same time. Usually a set of pitches within a known
reference set (e.g. the European tempered scale).
CHORUSING
45
A process of making a single musical source (e.g. a voice) sound like a group of similar sources all
making the same sound (e.g. a chorus of singers singing the same pitch).
CHROMATIC SCALE
The european scale consisting of all the semitone divisions of the octave.
COMB-FILTER TRANSPOSITION
65
A quick method of achieving octave-upward transposition of a sound, where its pitch is known.
COMB-FILTERING

114
COMPRESSION
60
Reducing the loudness of a sound by greater amounts where the sound itself becomes louder.
CONSTRUCTED CONTINUATION
The extension of a sound by some compositional process (e.g. brassage, zigzagging).
CONSTRUCTIVE DISTORTION
A process which generates musically interesting artefacts from the intrinsic properties of the waveform
or the (time-varying) spectrum of a sound.
CONTINUATION
Where sounds are longer than grains, we hear how the sound qualities evolve in time, (their
morphology). These sounds have continuation.
CONTOUR
The shape of some property of a sound at one moment in time. In particular, the shape of the spectrum.
This is often referred to as Spectral Envelope. However, Envelope is also used to describe the
time-changing evolution of a property (especially Loudness). To avoid any confusion, this book
reserves Trajectory for such time-changing properties, and Contour for the instantaneous shape of a
property. The names of computer instruments may however use the term 'Envelope'.
The spectral contour describes the overall loudness contour of the spectrum at a single moment in time.
But note that the spectral contour may itself evolve (change) through time.
CORRUGATION
60
CROTCHET = 120
An indication of the speed at which musical events succeed one another. Here the duration unit,
crotchet, occurs 120 times every second. This speed is known as the Tempo.
CSOUND
A general purpose computer language which allows a composer to describe a sound-generating
procedure (synthesis method) and ways to control it, in almost any degree of detail, and to define a
sequence of events (a score) using the sounds generated, and which then generates the sound events
thus defined. CSound is the most recent development of a series of such general purpose synthesis
engines, and the one in most common use at the time of writing (Autumn, 1994).

DENSITY
Describes the way in which a range is filled. Applies particularly to time ranges. A high-density texture
has a great many events in a short time. Temporal density is a primary property of
TEXTURE-STREAMS. The concept of density can also be applied to pitch-ranges.
DESTRUCTIVE DISTORTION
An irreversible transformation of the waveform of a sound, changing its spectral quality (the brightness,
noisiness etc), rather than the pitch or duration. Distortion also implies the degradation of the sound
(and irreversibility means that the original sound cannot be restored from the distorted version).
Destructive distortion which preserves zero-crossing points can be musically useful. See
WAVESETS.
DIPHONE SYNTHESIS
The reconstruction of speech (usually) by synthesising the transitions between significant phonemes
(roughly speaking, vowels & consonants) rather than the phonemes themselves.
DRONE
A pitched or multipitched sustained sound which persists for a long time.
DUCKING
62
Means of ensuring the prominence of a lead 'voice' in a mix.
DURATION
The length of time a sound persists. Not to be confused with event-onset-separation-dration which is
the time between the start of successive sound events.
DYNAMIC INTERPOLATION
The process whereby a sound gradually changes into a different (kind of) sound during the course of a
single sonic event.

EDITING
The processes of cutting sounds into shorter segments or/and splicing together sounds or segments of
sounds.
ENVELOPE
The loudness trajectory of a sound (the way the loudness varies through time) is often referred to as
the envelope of the sound. Computer instruments which manipulate this loudness trajectory are usually
called 'Envelope something'. Envelope is also used in the literature to refer to the time-changing
variation of any property (we use the term trajectory) and even to the instantaneous shape of the
spectrum (we use the term contour).

FIBONACCI SERIES
Series of numbers in which each term is given by the sum of the previous two terms. The sequence
begins with 1,1 and is hence..
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 etc
The ratio between successive terms

approaches closer and closer to the Golden Section as one goes up the series.
FIELD
A set of values defined for some property. e.g. the pitches of the scale of G minor define a Field. Any
pitch of the tempered scale lies either in that field or outside it. Any pitch within the pitch continuum lies
close (in some perceptually defined sense) to that Field or not.

FOURIER TRANSFORM
A mathematical procedure which allows us to represent any arbitrary waveform as a sum of elementary
sinusoidal waveforms. It is used in Fourier Analysis. See also INVERSE FOURIER TRANSFORM.
FREQUENCY
3,4
A steady sound has a definite repeating shape, a waveform, and this waveform a definite length, which
takes a certain time to pass the listener. The number of waveforms that pass in each second (the
number of cycles per second) is known as the frequency of the wave. The frequency of the wave helps to
determine the pitch we hear.

H
HARMONIC
In traditional European practice, harmonic means pertaining to harmony and relates particularly to tonal
music. In sound composition, harmonic refers to the property of a spectrum where all the partials are
multiples of some (audible) fundamental frequency. These partials are then known as harmonics, the
spectrum is said to be harmonic and the sound has a single definite pitch. (See also INHARMONIC).
These two usages are incompatible, so in the text we use HArmonic to refer to the traditional usage,
and harmonic to refer to the sound-compositional usage.
HARMONIC FIELD
A reference frame of pitches. This might be thought of as a chord. All pitches in a texture controlled by a
HArmonic Field will fall on one or other of the pitches of the chord.
HARMONICITY
The property of having a harmonic spectrum.
HARMONICS
4
The partials of a sound of definite pitch are (usually) exact multiples of some (audible) frequency known
as the fundamental. In this case the partials are known as the harmonics of the sound.
HARMONISER
38
Application of brassage with tape-speed transposition to change the pitch of a sound without altering
its duration. Generic name of commercially available hardware units which do both this and a number of
other grain time-frame brassage procedures (e.g. duration change without pitch-change).
HARMONY
In European music, the rules governing the sounding-together of pitches, and the sequencing of chords.
HOMOPHONIC
Music in which there are several parts (instruments or voices) but all parts sound simultaneously
(though not necessarily with the same pitch) at each musical event.
HPITCH
Pitch in a sense which refers to a HArmonic Field or to European notions of Harmony. In contrast to
pitch as a property of a spectrum.

INDIAN RAG SYSTEM
The system of scales and associated figures and ornaments at the base of Classical Indian music theory

INHARMONIC
A spectrum which is not harmonic, but which is not noise, is said to be inharmonic. Inharmonic spectra
may be bell-like (suggesting several pitches) or drum-like (being focused in some sense but lacking
definitive pitch).
INTERPOLATION
The process of moving gradually between two defined states. See SPECTRAL INTERPOLATION.
INVERSE FOURIER TRANSFORM

LOUDNESS
Technically speaking, loudness is a property which is related to perception, and is measured in a way
which takes into account the varying sensitivity of the ear over different frequency ranges. In this sense
it differs from the Amplitude of the signal, which is a scientific measure of the strength of a sound. In
this book, the term loudness is used in the text, wherever this will not cause any confusion. Diagrams
usually refer to Amplitude.

MAJOR
Most european music uses one of two scale patterns, known as the major scale and the minor scale
(the latter having a number of variants).
META-INSTRUMENT
An instrument which provides control instructions for another instrument. E.g. the mixing of sounds is
controlled by a mixing score (which may be a graphic representation of sounds and their entry times, or
a written list in a computer file). A meta-instrument might write or modify the mixing instructions
according to criteria supplied by the composer, or in response to other data.
MF
mezzo forte = moderately loud.
MIDI
Acronym for Musical Instrument Digital Interface. This is a communication protocol for messages sent
between different digital musical instruments and computers. MIDI stores information on which key is
pressed or released, how forcefully (or quickly) it is pressed, and on certain kinds of control information
provided by controllers on digital instruments (e.g. pitch-glide, tremolo etc), together with more
instrument specific data (which synthesis patch is being used). MIDI does NOT record the sound itself.
MINOR
Most european music uses one of two scale patterns, known as the major scale and the minor scale.
The minor scale has two important variants, the melodic and the harmonic minor.
MIX-SHUFFLING
47
MIXING
46
MIXING SCORE
A set of instructions detailing what will happen when a number of sounds are MIXED together. This
might be a text file or a graphic display on a computer, but could equally well be a set of instructions for
moving faders on a mixing desk in a studio. A typical mixing score would contain information about
which sounds were to be used, at what time each would start, how loud each would be, and at what
spatial position each should be placed.
MONO
Sound emanating from a single source (e.g. a single loudspeaker) or a single channel of digital
information. As opposed to stereo.
124
MORPHOLOGY
The way in which the properties of a sound vary with time.
MOTIF
Small element of musical structure, usually consisting of a sequence of a few pitches (in notated music),
and out of which larger structural units (e.g. phrases) are built.
MULTI-DIMENSIONAL SPACE
A line defines a one-dimensional space, a sheet of paper or the surface (only) of a sphere a
two-dimensional space, and the world we live in is a three-dimensional space. We may generalise the
notion of a space to any group of independent parameters. e.g. pitch and duration may be thought of as
defining a two-dimensional space, and this is the space that we draw in when we notate a traditional
musical score. Spaces may be of any number of dimensions (i.e. not necessarily ones that we can
visualise in our own spatial experience) from the four dimensions of Einstein's space-time, to the
infinite number of dimensions in Hilbert space.
MULTI-SOURCE BRASSAGE
45
NOISE
Sound having no perceptible pitch(es) and in which energy is distributed densely and randomly over the
spectrum and/or in a way which varies randomly with time. Typical examples might be the consonants
's' or 'sh'. Other sounds (especially those recorded directly from the natural environment) may contain
elements of unwanted noise which we may wish to eliminate by noise reduction.
NOISE REDUCTION
Process of eliminating or reducing unwanted noise in a sound source.
NOTCH FILTER

125
OCTAVE
A sound whose pitch is an octave higher than a second sound, usually has twice the frequency of that
second sound. Two pitches separated by an octave, in european music, are regarded in some sense as
the 'same' pitch, or as belonging to the same 'pitch-class'.
OCTAVE-STACKING

PARAMETER
Any property of a sound or a sequence of sounds which can be musically organised, Parameter often
also implies the measurability of that property.
PARTIAL

PARTIAL TRACKING
21
PERMUTATION
Specific rearrangement of the elements, or the properties of the elements (e.g. loudness), of a sequence
of musical events.
PHASE
9
PHASE INVERSION
(9)
The sound waveform may be replaced by the same form but 'upside-down' (i.e. the new wave rises
where the other falls and vice versa). The same-effect is achieved with a sinusoidal waveform by
restarting the wave from the first point at which it recrosses the zero-line (known as a phase-shift by
180 degrees, or by PI radians). Superimposing the original sound on its phase-inverted version causes
the sounds to cancel one another.
126
PHASE VOCODER
11
Instrument producing a moment-by-moment analysis of a sound waveform to reveal its time-evolving
spectrum. A windowed Fast Fourier Transform.
PHASING
9
PHONEME
A fundamental sound unit of a language, Crudely speaking we may think of vowels and consonants (as
heard, rather than as written) but the true definition is more subtle.
PHRASE
Element of musical structure consisting of a sequence of sound events and, in traditional practice,
usually lasting for a few bars.
PHYSICALITY
The physical nature of the apparent source of the sound. NOT the physical nature of the real source. Is
the apparent source hard or soft, rigid or flexible, granular of of-a-piece etc.
PITCH
4
A property of instrumental and vocal sounds organised in most traditional musical practices. Pitch
arises from a regular arrangement of partials in the spectrum. All partials are multiples of some
fundamental frequency which is audible (and which may or may not be present in the spectrum), and in
this case they are known as the harmonics of the sound. In the simplest case (the sine wave) there is
only the fundamental present. Humans hear pitch between approximately 16 cycles per second and 4000
cycles per second. Below 16 cps, the sound breaks up into a grain-stream. Above 4000 cycles we may
still be aware of tessitura (relative pitch-range) but assigning specific pitch becomes more problematic.
PITCH-GLIDE
See PORTAMENTO.
PITCH-TRACKING
70,71

PITCH-TRACKING BY PARTIAL ANALYSIS
71
PITCH-TRANSFER
Imposing (time-varying) pitch of a sound on a different sound.
127
PORTAMENTO
Sliding of pitch. Often incorrectly referred to as glissando, but there is an important distinction. On a
fretted or keyed instrument like a piano, we may slide fingers from a high pitch to a low pitch, but the
keys allow us to access only the pitches of the scale, and we hear a rapid descending scale passage: a
glissando. On a trombone or violin, a similar motion with the slide, or the finger along the string, causes
pitch to fall through the continuum, without picking out intervening scale pitches: a portamento.
PROCESS-FOCUSSED TRANSFORMATION
Some musical processes will so radically alter a source sound that the perceived goal-sound is more
dependent on the process of transformation than on the source itself. The same process applied to two
very different sources will produce very similar goal-sounds. The perceived result of the procedure
is
governed more by the artefacts of the process of transformation, rather than by the particular nature of
the source-sounds employed.
Q
8
The steepness with which a filter cuts out unwanted frequencies.
QUANTISATION
Forcing the timing of events on to a time grid of a specific size. E.g. we may set a grid at 0.01 seconds.
Any event must then fall at some multiple of 0.01 seconds. ALternatively we may set a grid at some
division of the metrical unit e.g. a grid of demi-semi-quavers. All events must then fall on some
multiple of demi-semiquaver divisions of the beat. The actual time quantisation will then also be
determined by the tempo (the number of crotchets per second). The quantisation grid provides a time
reference-frame. On keyed or fretted instruments, pitch is similarly quantised.
QUARTER TONE
A very small division of the musical scale. Half a semitone (the smallest interval accessible on a
standard European keyboard instrument, like a piano).
128
R
RANDOM-CUTTING
41
REFERENCE FRAME
A set of values which provide a reference set against which other values can be measured. e.g. the
chromatic scale as a reference set for european harmony, the set of vowels in standard english as a
reference set for classifying regional accents etc.
RESONANCE
If an object is vibrated it will produce a sound. Due to its particular weight, size and shape there will be
certain frequencies at which it will vibrate 'naturally'. If supplied with frequency-unspecific energy it
will tend to vibrate at these natural resonant frequencies. A flute tube with a certain combination of
closed holes has specific resonant frequencies which produce the pitches for that fingering. A hall or
building will reinforce certain frequencies in a voice, orchestra etc which fall on its natural resonant
frequencies.
RETROGRADE
The performance of a sequence of sound events in the reverse order. A-B-C-D-E becomes
E-D-C-B-A. Note that the sound-events themselves are not reversed.
REVERBERATION
64
RITARDANDO
A decrease in the speed at which musical events succeed one another.
SAMPLER
A piece of hardware, or a software package on a computer, which that digitally records any sound and
allows it to be manipulated (e.g. pitch-change by 'tape-speed' variation with the specific transposition
information sent from a MIDI keyboard). The sounds recorded on a sampler are often referred to in the
commercial literature as 'samples'. These should not be confused with the individual numbers used to
record the shape of the waveform itself, which are properly known as samples. (See SAMPLING).
SAMPLING
1
Sound is digitally recorded by sampling the value of the (electrical analogue of the) sound wave, at
regular time- intervals. These time intervals must be very short if high frequencies in the sound are to
be resolved. (e.g. between 22000 and 48000 samples per second). At a sampling rate of 48000 samples
per second, the highest resolvable frequency is 24000 cycles per second.
129
SCORE
The notation of a piece of music from which a performance of the work is recreated.
SEMITONE
The smallest interval between consecutive pitches on a modern European keyboard or fretted
instrument. Musical scales are defined as some pattern of tones (equal to two semitones) and
semitones, HArmonic minor scales also containing a three semitone step.
SEQUENCE GENERATION
1
SEQUENCES
Groups of consecutive sounds having distinctly different spectral properties. e.g. speech, or melodic
phrases on keyed instruments (the spectra of whose elements differ by perceptually significant pitch
steps).
SERIAL COMPOSITION
Style of twentieth century European musical composition in which the 12 pitches of the chromatic scale
are arranged in a specific order, and this sequence (and certain well-specified transformations of it) are
used as the basis for the organisation of pitches in a piece. The general idea of serialism was also
extended to sequences of durations, of loudnesses etc. The even more general notion of permuting a
given set of elements has been more widely used (e.g. systems music).
SERIALISM

SRUTI
The smallest unit into which the octave is divided in classical Indian music and from which the various
rag scales can be derived. It is at least 6 times smaller than a semitone. This is more of a theoretical
unit of measurement than a practically applied unit. In contrast, the Western semitone is built into the
structure of its keyboard instruments.
STATIC INTERPOLATION
The process whereby a sound gradually changes into a different (kind of) sound during a series of
repetitions of the sound, where each repeated unit is changed slightly away from the previous one and
towards the goal sound.
STEREO
Sound emanating from two channels (e.g. two loudspeaker) or stored as two channels of digital
information. As opposed to mono (from a single source). Sound information provided through two
loudspeakers is able to convey information about the (apparent) positioning of sound sources in the
intervening space between the loudspeakers, rather than suggesting merely a pair of sound sources.
132
STOCHASTIC PROCESSES
A process in which the probabilities of proceeding from one state, or set of states, to another, is defined.
The temporal evolution of the process is therefore governed by a kind of weighted randomness, which
can be chosen to give anything from an entirely determined outcome, to an entirely unpredictable one.
SYNTHESIS
Process of generating a sound from digital data, or from the parameters supplied to an electrical
oscillator. Originally synthetic sounds were recognisably such, but now it is possible, through a process
of careful analysis and subtle transformation, to recreate a recorded sound in a changed form which
however sound as convincingly 'natural' as the recording of the original sound.

The tuning of the scales used in European music., a system which became firmly established in the
early eighteenth century. In tempered tuning the octave is divided into 12 exactly equal semitones. i.e.
the ratio between the frequencies of any two pitches which are a semitone apart is exactly the same. In
a harmonic spectrum, the frequencies of the partials are exact multiples of some fundamental frequency.
The ratio of their frequencies form a pattern known as the harmonic series i.e.
2/1 3/2 4/3 5/4 6/5 7/6
and the frequency ratios between members of this series are known as 'pure' intervals. Some pure
interval ratios are..
octave..2/1
4th
4/3
5th.....3/2
7th
7/4
There is no common smaller interval from which all these 'pure' intervals can be constructed. Hence the
striving to achieve some kinds of compromise tunings, of which the tempered scale is just one example.
Apart from the octave, the tempered scale only approximates frequency ratios of the pure intervals. The
7th has no close approximation in the tempered scale.
TEMPO
The rate at which musical events occur. In european music the relative duration of events are indicated
by note values e.g. a crotchet is as long as two quavers. The speed of the whole will be indicated by a
tempo marking e.g.
crotchet = 120
which means there are to be 120 crotchets in one minute.
133
TESSITURA
Also known as register. In its simplest sense, the range of pitch in question. The tessitura of soprano
voices is higher than that of Tenor voices. However, unpitched (e.g. noise) sounds may rise in tessitura
while having no perceivable pitch, while SHEPARD TONES may rise in tessitura while falling in
pitch(!). Hence tessitura also has something to do with where the main focus of energy lies in the
spectrum (where the loudest groups of partials are to be found).
TEXTURE
Organisation of sound elements in terms of (temporal) density and field properties.
TEXTURE CONTROL
68-69
TEXTURE GENERATION
68-69
TEXTURE OF GROUPS
68
Texture in which small sets of sound elements are considered as the organisable units of the texture,
rather than individual sounds themselves. The sounds forming any particular group are, however,
chosen arbitrarily from the available sound sources.
TEXTURE OF MOTIFS
69
Texture in which specific small sets of sound elements, known as motifs, are considered as the
organisable units of the texture, rather than individual sounds themselves. The sounds forming any
particular motif are in some kind of predefined arrangement (e.g. some combination of sequence, time-
placement, pitch-relationship, formant sequence, etc).
TEXTURE OF ORNAMENTS
69
Texture in which specific small sets of sound elements, known as ornaments, are attached to the
fundamental sound elements of the texture, and each of these may be organised as units of the texture.
TEXTURE STREAM
Dense and relatively disordered sequence of sound events in which specific ordering properties
between individual elements cannot be perceived. Properties may be ordered in terms of Field and
Density.
THRESHOLD
A value either not to be exceeded (or fallen below), or to be noted (in order to cause something else to
happen) if it is thus exceeded.
134
TIMBRE
A catch-all term for all those aspects of a sound not included in pitch and duration. Of no value to the
sound composer!
TIME STRETCHING
See spectral time-stretching, granular time-stretching, waveset time-stretching, harmoniser,
brassage.
TIME-DOMAIN REPRESENTATION
The waveform of a sound represented as the variation of air- - pressure with time.
TIME-VARIABLE TIME-STRETCHING
See time-warping.
TIME-WARPING
30
Changing the duration of a sound in a way which itself varies with time.
TONAL MUSIC
Music organised around keys and the progression between different keys. In contrast, atonal music
avoids indicating the dominance of any particular key or pitch.
TONE
The interval between the first two pitches of a major (or minor) scale in European music. European
scales consist of patterns of tones and semitones (half a tone) and, in some cases 3-semitone steps.
TRAJECTORY
The variation of some property with time. e.g. loudness trajectory, pitch trajectory, formant trajectory.
Loudness trajectory is often also known as 'envelope' and instruments which manipulate the loudness
trajectory are here called 'Envelope something'.
TREMOLO
66
Cyclical undulations of loudness between C. 4 and 20 cycles per second.
TRANSPOSITION
Changing the pitch of a sound, or sound sequence.
TRIGGERING
62
Using the value of some time-varying property (usually the loudness) of a sound to cause something
else to happen.
135
TRITONE
The musical interval of 6 semitones. In the European tempered scale, a frequency ratio of the square
root of 2, to 1.
UNDULATION
cyclical change in the value of a musical property, like the rising and falling of pitch in vibrato, or of
loudness in tremolo.
VIBRAPHONE
A musical instrument consisting of pitched metal bars suspended over resonating tubes. When the bars
are struck they produce a specific pitch. and the associated tube resonates at that pitch. A motor drives
a small rotary blade inside the tube, adding slight vibrato-tremolo to the resonated sound.
VIBRATO
66
Cyclical undulations of pitch between c. 4 and 20 cycles per second.

WAVESET
50
WAVESET DISTORTION
52
Generally refers to any process which irreversibly alters the wavesets in a sound e.g. waveset
inversion, omission, reversal, shaking, shuffling, substitution, averaging and harmonic distortion.
Specifically used to refer to power-distortion i.e. raising each sample value of the sound to a power
(e.g. squaring, cubing, taking the square root).

WHITE-OUT
A musical process in which a texture becomes so dense that all spectral detail is lost, producing a noise
band.
WINDOW
In sound analysis (conversion from waveform to spectrum, to spectral envelope or to time-varying
filter-coefficients : see LPC) a window is a very brief slice of time (a few milliseconds) in which we
make a spectral analysis, before passing to the next window to make our next analysis. We hence
discover how the spectrum changes in time. Not to be confused with analysis CHANNEL.
WINDOWED FFT
A Fast Fourier Transform that is performed over a brief slice of time (a window), then performed over
and over again at successive windows throughout the entire duration of the sound. The Phase Vocoder
is a windowed FFT.
137
ZERO-CROSSING
The waveform of a sound continually rises above the centre line and then falls below it. The point where
it crosses the centre line is a zero-crossing.
