HARMONIC
In traditional European practice, harmonic means pertaining to harmony and relates particularly to tonal
music. In sound composition, harmonic refers to the property of a spectrum where all the partials are
multiples of some (audible) fundamental frequency. These partials are then known as harmonics, the
spectrum is said to be harmonic and the sound has a single definite pitch. (See also INHARMONIC).
These two usages are incompatible, so in the text we use HArmonic to refer to the traditional usage,
and harmonic to refer to the sound-compositional usage.
HARMONIC FIELD
A reference frame of pitches. This might be thought of as a chord. All pitches in a texture controlled by a
HArmonic Field will fall on one or other of the pitches of the chord.
HARMONICITY
The property of having a harmonic spectrum.

The partials of a sound of definite pitch are (usually) exact multiples of some (audible) frequency known
as the fundamental. In this case the partials are known as the harmonics of the sound.
HARMONISER
38
Application of brassage with tape-speed transposition to change the pitch of a sound without altering
its duration. Generic name of commercially available hardware units which do both this and a number of
other grain time-frame brassage procedures (e.g. duration change without pitch-change).
HARMONY
In European music, the rules governing the sounding-together of pitches, and the sequencing of chords.
HOMOPHONIC
Music in which there are several parts (instruments or voices) but all parts sound simultaneously
(though not necessarily with the same pitch) at each musical event.
HPITCH
Pitch in a sense which refers to a HArmonic Field or to European notions of Harmony. In contrast to
pitch as a property of a spectrum.
