PHASE VOCODER
11
Instrument producing a moment-by-moment analysis of a sound waveform to reveal its time-evolving
spectrum. A windowed Fast Fourier Transform.
PHASING
9
PHONEME
A fundamental sound unit of a language, Crudely speaking we may think of vowels and consonants (as
heard, rather than as written) but the true definition is more subtle.
PHRASE
Element of musical structure consisting of a sequence of sound events and, in traditional practice,
usually lasting for a few bars.
PHYSICALITY
The physical nature of the apparent source of the sound. NOT the physical nature of the real source. Is
the apparent source hard or soft, rigid or flexible, granular of of-a-piece etc.
PITCH
4
A property of instrumental and vocal sounds organised in most traditional musical practices. Pitch
arises from a regular arrangement of partials in the spectrum. All partials are multiples of some
fundamental frequency which is audible (and which may or may not be present in the spectrum), and in
this case they are known as the harmonics of the sound. In the simplest case (the sine wave) there is
only the fundamental present. Humans hear pitch between approximately 16 cycles per second and 4000
cycles per second. Below 16 cps, the sound breaks up into a grain-stream. Above 4000 cycles we may
still be aware of tessitura (relative pitch-range) but assigning specific pitch becomes more problematic.
PITCH-GLIDE
