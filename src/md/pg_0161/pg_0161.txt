GRAIN
Sound having a duration which is long enough for spectral properties to be perceived but not long
enough for time-fluctuation of properties to be perceived.
GRAIN-STREAM
A sound consisting of a rapid sequence of similar onsets.
GRAIN TIME-FRAME
The typical duration of a grain.
GRANULAR PROCESSES
56-57
Musical processes which preserve the grains within a grain- stream.
GRANULAR RECONSTRUCTION
73
A procedure which chops a sound into a number of segments and then redistributes these in a texture of
definable density. The process differs from BRASSAGE in that the segments need not be rejoined tail
to head. Granular Reconstruction of output density I is brassage.
GRANULAR REORDERING
57
GRANULAR REVERSAL
56
GRANULAR SYNTHESIS
A process, almost identical to granular reconstruction, in which very brief sound elements are generated
with particular (time-varying) properties and a particular (time-varying) density, to create a new
sound.
GRANULAR TIME SHRINKING BY GRAIN DELETION
56
GRANULAR TIME SHRINKING BY GRAIN SEPARATION
56
GRANULAR TIME STRETCHING BY GRAIN DUPLICATION
56
GRANULAR TIME STRETCHING BY GRAIN SEPARATION
56
GRANULAR TIME WARPING
Granular time-stretching or time-shrinking, which itself varies in time.
