We can go further than this. We might rearrange the grains in some new order (grain reordering). A rising succession of pitched sounds might thus be converted into a (motivic) sequence. (Sound example 6.18). Or we might move the pitch of individual grains without altering the time-sequence of the stream, or alter the timing on individual grains without altering their pitch, or some combination of both. In this way the control of grain-streams passes over into more conventional notions of event sequencing, melody and rhythm. I will not dwell on these here because hundreds of books have already been written about melody and rhythm, whereas sound composition is a relatively new field. We will therefore concentrate on what can be newly achieved, assuming that what is already known about traditional musical parameters is already part of our compositional tool kit.
