SPECTRUM
2,3
Representation of a sound in terms of the frequencies of its partials (those sinusoidal waves which can
be summed to produce the actual waveform of the sound). The frequency- domain representation of the
sound.
SPLICING
40
The tail to head joining of two sounds. In the classical tape studio this would be achieved by joining the
end of one sound tape to the beginning of another, using sticky tape.
SQUARE WAVE
5
SRUTI
The smallest unit into which the octave is divided in classical Indian music and from which the various
rag scales can be derived. It is at least 6 times smaller than a semitone. This is more of a theoretical
unit of measurement than a practically applied unit. In contrast, the Western semitone is built into the
structure of its keyboard instruments.
STATIC INTERPOLATION
The process whereby a sound gradually changes into a different (kind of) sound during a series of
repetitions of the sound, where each repeated unit is changed slightly away from the previous one and
towards the goal sound.
STEREO
Sound emanating from two channels (e.g. two loudspeaker) or stored as two channels of digital
information. As opposed to mono (from a single source). Sound information provided through two
loudspeakers is able to convey information about the (apparent) positioning of sound sources in the
intervening space between the loudspeakers, rather than suggesting merely a pair of sound sources.
