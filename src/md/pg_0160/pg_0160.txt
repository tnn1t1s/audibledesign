FOURIER ANALYSIS
2
The representation of the waveform of a sound as a set of simpler (sinusoidal) waveforms. The new
representation is known as the spectrum of the sound.
FOURIER TRANSFORM
A mathematical procedure which allows us to represent any arbitrary waveform as a sum of elementary
sinusoidal waveforms. It is used in Fourier Analysis. See also INVERSE FOURIER TRANSFORM.
FREQUENCY
3,4
A steady sound has a definite repeating shape, a waveform, and this waveform a definite length, which
takes a certain time to pass the listener. The number of waveforms that pass in each second (the
number of cycles per second) is known as the frequency of the wave. The frequency of the wave helps to
determine the pitch we hear.
